Installation instructions:
========================= 

1. Update HP-UX Kernel
----------------------
General instructions on preparation for installing and proceeding with an
installation of IPFilter on HP-UX can be found at:
http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/ipf-mentat.html

You are required to at least install the latest jumbo patches from HP,
for HP-UX 11.  A summary of those that I used can be found at:
At http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/ipf-hp11.html

I do not recommend using anything less than as many of these as will apply
to your own system.

2. Build and Install pfil
-------------------------
Next, you need to download and install "pfil".  This is a STREAMS interface
for packet filtering that removes the need for packet filtering code to be
written as a STREAMS module.  This can be downloaded from

http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/pfil-2.1.1.tar.gz

Unpack this and type "make" in the pfil directory.  Once compelte, type
"make install" to kick off the installation.

3. Build and Install IP Filter
------------------------------
Having got this far, you now need to download the latest IP Filter package
and compile/install that.  The source code for IP Filter can be obtained
from:
http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/ip-filter.html

Download the latest version that is 4.1 or greater.

This should be unpacked into the same directory as "pfil" is.  The
directory layout will look like this:

/directory/ip_fil4.*
/directory/pfil

This complete, do a "make hpux" in the ip_fil4.* directory, followed
by a "make install".  You will need to reboot for it to become active.
